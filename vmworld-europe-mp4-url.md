# VMworld Europe 2018 Breakout Sessions .mp4) URLs

[William Lam](https://github.com/lamw/vmworld2018-session-urls) has built a nice summary list of all VMworld US and Europe 2018 Breakout session with the respective video playback URLs. So I just transformed that URLs into the final .mp4) so you can download the sessions easily directly from here using DownThemAll! (I've used WaterFox as it does support the extension still)
